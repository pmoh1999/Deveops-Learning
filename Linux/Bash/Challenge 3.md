if test -f $filename; then
    echo "File $filename exists";
    else
        echo "File $filename doesn't exist."
fi

readable=

if [ -r $filename ]; then
    readable="is readable"
    else
    readable="is not readable"
fi

writable=
if [ -w $filename ]; then
    writable="is writable"
    else
    writable="is not writable"
fi

executable=
if [ -w $filename ]; then
    executable="is executable"
    else
    executable="is not executable"
fi

echo "$filename $readable. $filename $writable. $filename $executable"

```
